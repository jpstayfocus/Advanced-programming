Advanced Programming in Java: Project, Labs, Assignments

In short this course deals with class design and the architecture of complex software solutions. i.e.  how  we specify, construct and combine objects to create new objects that will allow us to model real-world entities in our problem domain. We will also examine and use parts of the design language UML and talk about modes of communication between objects. Much of this will be used in illustrating the construction of class libraries. We shall be using the Java foundation classes and the Swing GUI libraries as practical examples of much of the theory.
